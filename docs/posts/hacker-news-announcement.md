# Building an x86_64 Instruction Encoder from Scratch

I’ve always been fascinated by how compilers actually turn code into bytes.  
Over the last few weeks I’ve been building **Rask**, a small x86_64 instruction encoder in Rust that generates machine code programmatically.

It’s meant for anyone who wants to understand instruction encoding or experiment with JIT compilation — without diving into LLVM’s massive complexity.


## What it does

Rask takes simple instruction descriptions and turns them into raw x86_64 machine code bytes:

```rust
use rask_x86_64::{encoder::Encoder, registers::Reg64::*, operand::Operand};

let mut encoder = Encoder::new();
encoder.mov(Operand::Reg(RAX), Operand::Imm(1337));
encoder.add(RAX, RBX);
encoder.ret();

let bytes = encoder.bytes();
// [0x48, 0xb8, 0x39, 0x05, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x48, 0x01, 0xd8, 0xc3]
```

That's valid machine code that loads 1337 into RAX, adds RBX to it, and returns.

## Why build this?

LLVM is incredibly powerful but has a steep learning curve and massive compile times. Cranelift is better but still complex for simple use cases. I wanted something you could actually read and understand. I didn’t plan for it to be a full backend — just a weekend experiment that slowly grew legs.

The goal isn't to compete with these tools on features or performance. It's to provide a clean foundation for:
- Learning x86_64 instruction encoding
- Prototyping JIT compilers
- Building custom assemblers or analysis tools
- Understanding how CPUs actually execute code

## Technical details

The interesting parts were getting the encoding details right:

**REX prefixes** - x86_64 uses REX prefixes to access extended registers (R8-R15). The encoder automatically generates the correct prefix based on which registers you use:

```rust
encoder.mov(Operand::Reg(RAX), Operand::Imm(42));  // REX: 0x48
encoder.mov(Operand::Reg(R10), Operand::Imm(42));  // REX: 0x49
```

**Memory addressing** - Supporting different displacement sizes was tricky. The encoder chooses the most compact encoding:

```rust
let mem = MemOperand { base: RBX, disp: 8 };     // 8-bit displacement
encoder.mov(Operand::Reg(RAX), Operand::Mem(mem));

let mem = MemOperand { base: RBX, disp: 1000 };  // 32-bit displacement  
encoder.mov(Operand::Reg(RAX), Operand::Mem(mem));
```

**ModR/M encoding** - This byte specifies registers and addressing modes. Getting the bit layout right for all combinations took careful reading of Intel's documentation.

## Current status

Rask is very early stage. It supports:
- MOV instructions (register-to-register, immediate-to-register, memory operations)
- Basic arithmetic (ADD, SUB)
- Function returns (RET)

Missing: jumps, calls, most instructions, optimizations, multiple architectures.

Every implemented instruction is tested against known-good byte sequences. The focus is on correctness over completeness.

## Design decisions

**Type safety** - The operand system catches encoding errors at compile time:

```rust
enum Operand {
    Reg(Reg64),
    Mem(MemOperand), 
    Imm(i64),
}
```

**Documentation** - Each instruction includes Intel SDM references and encoding details. You can understand what's happening without external docs.

**Modularity** - Split into `rask-common` (shared types) and `rask-x86_64` (architecture-specific). Future architectures will be separate crates.

**No magic** - Everything is explicit. No macros, no hidden code generation.

## Examples

The repo includes working examples:

- Basic encoding - demonstrates core instructions
- REX prefixes - shows extended register handling  
- Arithmetic operations - memory addressing and ModR/M encoding

You can see the exact byte sequences generated and verify them against disassemblers.

## Use cases

While Rask is experimental, the techniques are useful for:

**Dynamic code generation** - Generate optimized code at runtime based on input data

**Domain-specific languages** - Compile custom languages directly to machine code

**Performance analysis** - Generate test sequences to understand CPU behavior

**Education** - Learn low-level programming concepts with immediate feedback

## What's next

The immediate goal is expanding instruction support. Jumps and function calls are next, followed by more arithmetic operations.

Longer term, I'm interested in higher-level code generation patterns and potentially other architectures (ARM64).
